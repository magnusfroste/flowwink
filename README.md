## Vision

> **Every business will have an agentic operator. FlowWink is the operating system it runs on.**

## Mission

> **Give every business a self-hosted agentic operator that runs their website, qualifies their leads, creates their content, fulfills their orders, and grows their business — around the clock, without being prompted.**

---

## A new kind of business software

For decades, business software has been a collection of tools you operate manually — CMS, CRM, ERP, email, e-commerce — each requiring human input at every step.

**FlowWink is a Business Operating System (BOS):** a unified platform where an autonomous AI operator called **FlowPilot** runs your content, leads, orders, campaigns, accounting, and fulfillment — continuously, around the clock, without hand-holding.

You set the direction. FlowPilot operates the business.

---

## What FlowPilot does

FlowPilot is not a chatbot, a copilot, or a content suggester. It is an **autonomous agent** — a persistent process that wakes up on a configurable schedule (default: every 6 hours), reads your business situation, and acts.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     THE AUTONOMOUS LOOP                         │
│                                                                 │
│  Evaluate → Plan → Advance → Propose → Automate → Reflect      │
│      ↑                                                 │        │
│      └─────────── Remember ← ──────────────────────────┘        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| What FlowPilot does | How |
|---------------------|-----|
| Writes and publishes blog posts | Researches topics, drafts, SEO-optimizes, schedules |
| Qualifies and enriches leads | Scores, enriches from domain, routes to deals |
| Sends newsletter campaigns | Segments subscribers, drafts, schedules sends |
| Manages product promotions | Creates landing pages, promotional posts |
| Triages support tickets | Auto-categorizes, routes, resolves from Knowledge Base |
| Reviews deal pipeline | Surfaces stale deals, drafts re-engagement |
| Proposes new objectives | Reads site stats, spots gaps, creates its own goals |
| Federates with peer agents | Delegates tasks to external A2A agents via JSON-RPC |
| Evolves its own capabilities | Creates new skills, updates its instructions, reflects |

---

## Modules — 37 integrated domains

FlowWink follows an **Odoo-inspired modular architecture** where each module owns its data, views, and FlowPilot integration. Modules are registered as plugins with typed contracts.

| Category | Modules |
|----------|---------|
| **Content** | Pages, Blog, Knowledge Base, Global Blocks, Media, Templates, Handbook |
| **CRM** | Leads, Companies, Deals, Forms, Sales Intelligence |
| **Commerce** | Products, Orders, Bookings, Invoicing, Inventory |
| **Finance** | Accounting, Expenses, Timesheets |
| **Communication** | Newsletter, Webinars |
| **Support** | Tickets (Kanban + auto-triage via FlowPilot), Live Support |
| **Growth** | Analytics, Paid Growth, Company Insights, Resume/CV, Content Hub |
| **System** | FlowPilot, Federation (A2A), Browser Control, Developer, Site Migration |

Each module provides:
- **Data layer** — Supabase table + RLS policies
- **Admin views** — React components in `/admin/`
- **FlowPilot skills** — Agent capabilities auto-registered
- **Webhook events** — `module.action` signals for automation

---

## FlowPilot — Full Autonomy Engine

### Heartbeat Protocol (7 steps)

```
1. EVALUATE  — Score past actions against real outcomes (traffic, leads, revenue)
2. PLAN      — Decompose active objectives into executable steps
3. ADVANCE   — Execute the next pending step for each objective
4. PROPOSE   — If no active objectives, analyze stats and create new goals
5. AUTOMATE  — Detect recurring patterns, suggest or create automations
6. REFLECT   — Review recent actions, distill learnings
7. REMEMBER  — Save insights to semantic memory for future cycles
```

### Skills — 118 across your business

| Domain | Skills |
|--------|--------|
| **CMS** | Pages (create/publish/rollback), block manipulation, Global Elements |
| **Content** | Blog posts, KB articles, content research, SEO briefs, social batches |
| **CRM** | Leads, Companies, Deals, Form processing, Lead qualification, Company enrichment |
| **Commerce** | Products, Orders, Bookings, Invoicing, Inventory management |
| **Finance** | Accounting entries, Expense tracking, Timesheet analysis |
| **Communication** | Newsletter campaigns, Webinars |
| **Support** | Ticket triage, KB-powered auto-resolve |
| **Intelligence** | Analytics, SEO audits, web research, browser automation, prospect research |
| **Growth** | Ad campaigns, competitor monitoring, prospect fit analysis |
| **Learning** | Memory read/write (vector search), reflection, soul evolution |

### Workflow DAGs — Multi-step automation chains

```
Research topic → Write blog post → Create social posts → Schedule newsletter
     s1               s2                  s3                    s4
                  {{s1.topic}}     {{s2.post_id}}         {{s3.content}}
```

- **Template variables** — `{{stepId.result.field}}` passes data between steps
- **Conditional branching** — run a step only if a previous result meets a condition
- **Failure modes** — `on_failure: continue` or `stop` per step

### Outcome Evaluation Loop

FlowPilot uses **causal correlation** to connect actions to business outcomes:
- Traffic metrics, leads, bookings, and revenue signals
- Hard gates for technical failures (timeout, 429, auth errors)
- Skill Scorecard — flags underperforming skills (>60% negative rate)
- Learnings saved to semantic memory for the next planning cycle

### Multi-Agent Delegation

FlowPilot delegates subtasks to specialist sub-agents with persistent sessions:

```
FlowPilot → delegate_task("seo", "analyze /pricing page")
         → delegate_task("content", "write a case study about...")
         → delegate_task("sales", "review stale deals > $10k")
```

Built-in specialists: **seo**, **content**, **sales**, **analytics**, **email** — each maintains conversation history across invocations.

### Skill Packs

```
skill_pack_install("E-Commerce Pack")        → product_promoter, cart_recovery_check, inventory_report
skill_pack_install("Content Marketing Pack") → content_calendar_view, seo_content_brief, social_post_batch
skill_pack_install("CRM Nurture Pack")       → lead_pipeline_review, deal_stale_check, customer_health_digest
```

---

## A2A Federation — Agent-to-Agent Protocol

FlowWink implements the **A2A JSON-RPC 2.0** protocol for peer-to-peer agent communication:

```
┌─────────────┐    JSON-RPC 2.0    ┌─────────────┐
│  FlowPilot  │◄──────────────────▶│  Peer Agent  │
│ (gatekeeper)│   message/send     │  (e.g. OpenClaw)
│             │   tasks/send       │              │
└─────────────┘                    └─────────────┘
```

- **FlowPilot as gatekeeper** — all peer interactions routed through the autonomous agent
- **Peer management** — add, test, discover, and audit external agents
- **Graceful degradation** — 503 `peer_unavailable` handling when peers are offline
- **Audit loop** — architectural findings from peers auto-convert to agent objectives
- **Agent Card** — `/.well-known/agent.json` discovery endpoint

---

## Architecture

FlowWink follows the **OpenClaw** agentic architecture — composable layers with clear separation of concerns:

```

### One reasoning core, all surfaces

The Pilot engine (`_shared/pilot/`) is the single engine shared by every surface:
- **`agent-operate`** — interactive admin sessions (streaming)
- **`flowpilot-heartbeat`** — autonomous scheduled loop
- **`chat-completion`** — visitor-facing AI chat
- **`a2a-ingest`** — incoming federation requests

No logic duplication. All surfaces get every capability automatically.

### Modularized core

```
_shared/
├── pilot/
│   ├── reason.ts          — Main ReAct reasoning loop
│   ├── prompt-compiler.ts — System prompt assembly
│   ├── handlers.ts        — Built-in tool implementations
│   └── built-in-tools.ts  — Tool definitions
├── types.ts               — Shared type definitions
├── ai-config.ts           — Provider routing (OpenAI → Gemini → Local)
├── concurrency.ts         — Lane-based locking
├── token-tracking.ts      — Budget management
├── trace.ts               — Correlation IDs (fp_{ts}_{rand})
└── domains/
    └── cms-context.ts     — CMS domain pack
```

### Provider-agnostic, self-hosted first

```
OpenAI GPT-4o → Gemini 2.5 Flash → Local LLM (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM)
```

FlowPilot routes to whichever provider is configured. Use your own API keys. Run fully offline with a local model. No vendor lock-in.
