## What is FlowWink?

FlowWink is a modern, open-source Content Management System built for organizations that need:

- ✅ A complete website without developers
- ✅ Headless API for multi-channel delivery
- ✅ **AI chat with your content as context** — Instant value, no training needed
- ✅ GDPR and WCAG compliance built-in
- ✅ Full control with self-hosting

### Killer Feature: AI Chat with Multi-Module Context

**First system to use all your content as AI context:**

- Pages, blog posts, knowledge base articles
- Instant answers from your own content
- No training required — works immediately
- Saves hours of customer support time

### Use Case: Outreach-Focused Teams

For teams building their digital presence and lead generation:

```
AI → Blog (content) → Pages (landings) → Forms (capture)
→ Leads (nurture) → Newsletter (email) → Analytics (measure)
```

**5 modules = complete outreach loop:**
- **Pages** — Landings pages for campaigns
- **Blog** — Content marketing, SEO, thought leadership
- **Leads** — Capture leads from forms
- **Newsletter** — Nurture leads via email
- **AI** — Generate content 10x faster

### Head + Headless

Unlike traditional CMS (website only) or pure headless solutions (API only, requires separate frontend), FlowWink delivers **both**:

## Self-Hosting

FlowWink is **free to self-host**. Deploy on your own Supabase instance with full control over your data.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/magnusfroste/flowwink.git
cd flowwink

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials

# Run database migrations (see docs/SETUP.md)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Connecting to Your Own Supabase

The entire purpose of this project is to allow you to clone it from GitHub and connect it to **your own Supabase instance**. Here's how:

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project
   - Note your **project ref** (e.g., `trpejhoieysrwiuhskkm`) from the URL

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
   - Copy these three values:
     - **Project URL** → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
     - **Anon/Public key** → `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
     - **Project ref** → `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - For local development: Edit `.env` file
   - For deployment: Pass as build arguments (see DEPLOYMENT.md)

4. **Run Setup Script** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-supabase.sh
   ```
   This deploys edge functions and runs migrations automatically.

### Detailed Setup

See **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)** for complete self-hosting instructions including:

- Supabase project setup
- Database migrations
- Edge Functions deployment
- Production deployment

### Database Schema

A complete SQL schema is available at **[supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql)** — run it in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up a new instance.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Self-Hosting)

Deploy with Docker on any platform for complete control and easy upgrades:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/magnusfroste/flowwink:latest

# Or use docker-compose (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
docker-compose up -d
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Easy upgrades (`docker pull` for new versions)
- ✅ Works with Supabase Cloud OR Self-Hosted Supabase
- ✅ Deploy on Easypanel, Railway, Fly.io, or any VPS
- ✅ Your data, your infrastructure

**Platforms:**
- **Easypanel** — One-click Docker deployment with auto-HTTPS ([Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md))
- **Railway** — Git-based deployment with automatic builds
- **Fly.io** — Global edge deployment
- **VPS** — Any server with Docker (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### Option 2: Static Hosting (Alternative)

Deploy on static hosting platforms with your own Supabase backend:

| Component | Your Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or any static host |
| **Backend** | Your own Supabase project (Cloud or Self-Hosted) |
| **AI** | Private LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) |

See **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)** for complete self-hosting instructions.

### Option 3: Development/Testing with Lovable

For development and testing only (not recommended for production):

[![Remix on Lovable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Remix%20on-Lovable-ff69b4)](https://lovable.dev/projects/fac5f9b2-2dc8-4cce-be0a-4266a826f893)

**Note:** Remixing creates a fork that won't receive upstream updates. Use Docker deployment for production to maintain upgradeability.

See **[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** for complete deployment guides.

**AI Features:** When self-hosting, configure a Private LLM endpoint (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, or N8N) in the CMS admin panel.
