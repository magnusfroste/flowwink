# Making Your SaaS Agent-Ready

> How to transform a closed business platform into an open, orchestratable node in an agentic network — without losing your competitive edge.

---

## The Problem

You have a SaaS platform. It runs business logic — CRM, e-commerce, content, bookings, accounting. Today, a human operates it through a GUI. Tomorrow, an external AI agent needs to operate it on the human's behalf.

The question isn't *whether* this will happen. It's whether your platform will be the one that gets orchestrated — or the one that gets replaced.

## The Mindset Shift

Traditional SaaS thinking: **protect everything, expose nothing**.

Agentic SaaS thinking: **expose operations, protect identity**.

```
OLD MODEL                          NEW MODEL
┌─────────────┐                    ┌─────────────┐
│  Closed API  │                    │  MCP Surface │ ← External agents
│  GUI only    │                    │  ───────────│
│  Human ops   │                    │  Embedded    │ ← Native agent
└─────────────┘                    │  Agent       │
                                   └─────────────┘
```

The new model has two access layers:
1. **MCP Surface** — what external agents can see and do
2. **Embedded Agent** — the native operator with deep context

Both operate on the same business data. The difference is depth, not access.

---

## Step 1: Audit Your Skills

Every operation your platform performs is a "skill." Before exposing anything, categorize every skill into one of two buckets:

### Business Skills (Expose)

These operate on **platform data** — the data that belongs to the customer, not the agent:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Content | `write_blog_post`, `manage_page`, `publish_newsletter` |
| CRM | `add_lead`, `qualify_lead`, `manage_deal` |
| Commerce | `check_order_status`, `manage_product`, `process_refund` |
| Booking | `check_availability`, `book_appointment` |
| Accounting | `create_invoice`, `record_expense` |
| Communication | `send_newsletter`, `manage_webinar` |

**Rule: If a human employee would need this tool to do their job, an external agent needs it too.**

### Agent-Internal Skills (Protect)

These operate on **agent state** — the cognitive infrastructure of your embedded agent:

| Category | Examples | Why Protected |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Identity | `soul_update`, `identity_edit` | Cognitive sovereignty |
| Memory | `memory_write`, `memory_delete` | Prevents contamination |
| Reflection | `reflect`, `self_evaluate` | Internal process |
| Orchestration | `heartbeat_update`, `dispatch_mission` | Infrastructure |
| Federation | `a2a_handshake`, `peer_manage` | Security boundary |

**Rule: If it changes how the agent thinks rather than what the platform does, it stays internal.**

### The 90/10 Target

Aim for **~90% of business skills exposed**, **~0% of agent-internal skills exposed**. In our case: 110 of 126 skills (87%) are MCP-exposed, with 16 kept internal.

---

## Step 2: Enrich Tool Definitions

Exposing a skill isn't just flipping a boolean. External agents lack the institutional knowledge your embedded agent has. Every exposed skill needs three layers:

### The Three Pillars

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PILLAR 1: Tool Definition                       │
│  JSON Schema — parameters, types, required       │
│  → Machine-readable. Enables execution.          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PILLAR 2: Description                           │
│  Natural language — what it does, when to use    │
│  → Enables intent routing and skill selection.   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PILLAR 3: Instructions                          │
│  Domain expertise — how to use it well           │
│  → Enables competent execution.                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pillar 1** is table stakes — every API has a schema.

**Pillar 2** is what most people miss. A good description includes:
- What the tool does (one sentence)
- `Use when:` — explicit trigger conditions
- `NOT for:` — disambiguation from similar tools

Example:
```
"Browse published blog posts (visitor-facing).
 Use when: a user asks to see latest blog articles;
 you need to find existing blog content to link to.
 NOT for: managing blog post drafts (manage_blog_posts);
 listing blog categories (manage_blog_categories)."
```

**Pillar 3** is your embedded agent's secret advantage. Instructions contain domain expertise that external agents don't receive:
- Business rules ("always check stock before confirming orders")
- Workflow sequences ("after qualifying a lead, check for existing deals")
- Edge case handling ("if the customer is in EU, apply VAT rules")

> **Strategic note:** MCP currently has no `instructions` field. You can stuff instructions into the description, serve them as MCP resources, or keep them as your embedded agent's competitive advantage.

---

## Step 3: Implement Concurrency Controls

When two agents operate on the same platform, they will collide. The same lead gets contacted twice. The same order gets processed twice.

### The Lock Pattern

```
Agent A → acquire_lock("lead_xyz", ttl=60s)
  → Lock granted
  → Agent A works on lead_xyz
  → release_lock("lead_xyz")

Agent B → acquire_lock("lead_xyz", ttl=60s)
  → Lock denied (Agent A holds it)
  → Agent B moves to next task
```

Implementation: a `locks` table with lane-based advisory locks and automatic TTL expiry.

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_locks (
  lane TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  locked_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  locked_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() + interval '60 seconds'
);

CREATE FUNCTION try_acquire_agent_lock(p_lane TEXT, p_agent TEXT, p_ttl INT DEFAULT 60)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
  -- Delete expired locks first
  DELETE FROM agent_locks WHERE expires_at < now();
  -- Try to insert
  INSERT INTO agent_locks (lane, locked_by, expires_at)
  VALUES (p_lane, p_agent, now() + (p_ttl || ' seconds')::interval)
  ON CONFLICT (lane) DO NOTHING;
  -- Check if we got it
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM agent_locks
    WHERE lane = p_lane AND locked_by = p_agent
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql;
```

**Expose `acquire_lock` and `release_lock` as MCP tools.** Without this, multi-agent operation is unsafe.

---

## Step 4: Add Observability Resources

External agents need to understand the platform's current state without polling every table. MCP Resources provide read-only snapshots:

| Resource URI | Content | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `platform://health` | Module status, error rates, uptime | Situational awareness |
| `platform://activity` | Recent operations (last 20) | Coordination |
| `platform://identity` | Platform personality, brand voice | Consistency |
| `platform://objectives` | Active goals and progress | Alignment |
| `platform://automations` | Scheduled tasks, triggers | Avoid duplication |

**Rule: Resources are read-only. They inform, they don't mutate.**

---

## Step 5: Define the Trust Boundary

Not all external agents are equal. Implement trust tiers:

| Tier | Access | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Trusted Peer** | Full business skills + lock tools | OpenClaw with verified credentials |
| **Limited Peer** | Read-only resources + subset of skills | Analytics agent, monitoring bot |
| **Untrusted** | Public resources only | Discovery, capability queries |

Gate access through:
- **API key validation** — hash-verified keys with scopes
- **Skill-level flags** — `requires_approval: true` for destructive operations
- **Rate limiting** — prevent runaway agents from overwhelming the system

---

## The Result: A Federated Business Node

After these five steps, your SaaS is no longer a closed application. It's a **node in an agentic network**:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   YOUR SAAS PLATFORM                  │
│                                                      │
│  ┌────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐ │
│  │ Embedded   │  │ MCP Surface  │  │ Observability│ │
│  │ Agent      │  │ ~90% skills  │  │ Resources    │ │
│  │ (deep)     │  │ + lock tools │  │ (read-only)  │ │
│  └────────────┘  └──────┬───────┘  └──────────────┘ │
│                         │                            │
└─────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┘
                          │
            ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
            │             │             │
       ┌────┴────┐  ┌────┴────┐  ┌────┴────┐
       │OpenClaw │  │ Partner │  │Analytics│
       │Orchestr.│  │  Agent  │  │  Agent  │
       └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

### The Moat Paradox

By opening up, you don't lose your competitive advantage — you **shift** it:

- **Old moat:** Locked-down API, forced GUI usage → easily replaceable
- **New moat:** Deep domain logic, proactive embedded agent, institutional memory → indispensable

The platform that's easiest to orchestrate becomes the hardest to replace. Every external agent that integrates with your MCP surface creates a dependency. Every workflow that relies on your business rules makes switching costs higher.

**Openness is the new lock-in.**
