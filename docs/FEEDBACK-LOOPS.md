## The Problem

Most small businesses run their marketing, sales, and customer relationships in silos. A webinar here. A newsletter there. A spreadsheet somewhere. Nothing talks to anything else.

The result? Leads fall through the cracks. Follow-ups get forgotten. You have no idea which efforts actually drive revenue.

**FlowWink solves this with Growth Loops** — automated feedback cycles that connect every touchpoint into one continuous flow.

## What Is a Growth Loop?

A Growth Loop is the opposite of a funnel. Funnels leak. Loops compound.

```
         ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
         │                                  │
    Attract ──→ Capture ──→ Qualify ──→ Convert
         │                                  │
         └──── Learn ◄── Measure ◄──────────┘
```

Every interaction feeds back into the system. Every data point makes the next interaction smarter. Every loop iteration is more effective than the last.

## Five Growth Loops, One Platform

### Loop 1: Capture & Qualify

**The moment someone interacts with your business, FlowWink starts working.**

A visitor fills out a contact form. Registers for a webinar. Books a meeting. In a traditional setup, you get an email notification and maybe remember to add them to a spreadsheet.

In FlowWink, that single interaction triggers a cascade:

- A contact is created with full source tracking
- If they're from a known company, they're linked automatically
- An engagement score is calculated based on the action (a webinar registration signals higher intent than a page visit)
- AI analyzes the contact and generates a qualification summary
- The contact appears in your pipeline, ranked by score

**Zero manual data entry. Zero missed leads.**

The smart part: FlowWink only matches contacts to *existing* companies in your database. No auto-generated ghost companies from personal email domains. When you're ready to add a company, the system pre-fills the domain from the contact's email and lets you enrich it with AI in one click.

---

### Loop 2: Engage & Track

**Every interaction tells a story. FlowWink reads it for you.**

When a contact opens your newsletter, clicks a link, attends a webinar, or visits your site — each action is logged and scored:

| Action | Signal Strength |
|--------|----------------|
| Webinar registration | High intent |
| Form submission | High intent |
| Booking | High intent |
| Newsletter subscription | Medium intent |
| Link click | Medium intent |
| Email open | Low intent |
| Page visit | Low intent |

These signals compound over time. A contact who opened three newsletters, clicked two links, and then registered for a webinar has a very different score than someone who filled out a form once and went silent.

**You always know who's hot and who's not — without guessing.**

---

### Loop 3: Sell & Convert

**Your sales pipeline isn't separate from your marketing. It's the same loop.**

When you create a deal for a contact, FlowWink connects the dots:

- Contact status automatically updates as the deal progresses
- A new deal moves the contact from "lead" to "opportunity"
- A won deal marks them as "customer" and logs the revenue
- A lost deal is tracked for pattern analysis

Every stage change is logged in the contact's activity timeline. When you look at a customer six months later, you see the complete journey — from first webinar registration to signed contract.

**No more "where did this customer come from?" questions.**

---

### Loop 4: Enrich & Understand

**One piece of data unlocks an entire company profile.**

When you add a company to FlowWink, AI enrichment fills in the blanks: industry, company size, phone, website, address, description. This happens in seconds, not hours of manual research.

The enrichment benefits every contact linked to that company. When AI qualifies a lead, it uses the company context to generate smarter summaries and recommendations.

**Research that used to take 30 minutes now takes one click.**

---

### Loop 5: Measure & Improve

**If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.**

Every Growth Loop generates metrics:

- **Capture:** How many leads per source? Which channels convert best?
- **Engage:** What's your email open rate? Which content drives clicks?
- **Sell:** What's your pipeline value? What's your win rate?
- **Enrich:** How complete is your company data?

These aren't vanity metrics. They're actionable signals that tell you where to double down and where to cut.

**Data-driven decisions, not gut feelings.**

## Why Growth Loops Beat Funnels

| | Traditional Funnel | FlowWink Growth Loops |
|---|---|---|
| **Data flow** | One direction (top → bottom) | Circular (every output feeds back in) |
| **Manual work** | High (data entry, follow-ups, reporting) | Minimal (automated capture, scoring, qualification) |
| **Intelligence** | Static (same process for every lead) | Adaptive (AI learns from patterns) |
| **Visibility** | Fragmented (different tools, different dashboards) | Unified (one timeline, one score, one view) |
| **Compounding** | No (each lead starts from scratch) | Yes (company enrichment benefits all linked contacts) |

## The FlowWink Difference

### AI-Native, Not AI-Bolted

AI isn't a feature we added. It's woven into every loop:

- **AI Qualification** analyzes contacts and generates actionable summaries
- **AI Enrichment** fills in company profiles from a single domain
- **AI Content** helps you create blog posts, newsletters, and social content
- **AI Chat** lets your visitors get instant answers from your knowledge base

### Built for Small Business

No enterprise complexity. No 6-month implementation. No consultant required.

FlowWink gives you the growth infrastructure that used to require a marketing team, a sales team, and a data team — in one platform that you can set up in an afternoon.

### Open & Self-Hosted

Your data stays yours. FlowWink runs on your own infrastructure with Supabase. No vendor lock-in. No per-seat pricing that punishes growth.

## The Bottom Line

FlowWink isn't another CRM. It's not another website builder. It's not another email tool.

Every visitor interaction becomes a data point. Every data point feeds a smarter system. Every loop iteration brings you closer to your next customer.

That's what FlowWink means: **the flow that makes you visible.**
